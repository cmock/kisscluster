contains the definitions of the guest VMs for kisscluster.

this directory has one sub-directory per cluster, named after the
cluster. those directories have one YAML file per VM.

VM files must be named *.yml, other files (in the per-cluster
directories) are ignored; so you can disable machines by e.g. renaming
them to "*.yml.disabled"

this directory also has a file per cluster, "clustername.yml", which
is both the output of the processing and contains static, generated
information like DRBD minor numbers.

Also, the cluster protocol secret will be stored in a file
"clustername.secret" by the installation.

DO NOT DELETE THOSE FILES!
